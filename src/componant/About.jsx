          <h2>Chicago is Home</h2>
          <p>We are a remote company, but our roots are still firmly planted in Chicago. Each year we meet up in downtown Chicago for a week-long company retreat. This gives us all an oportunity to take a break from our normal routines, catch up with one another, learn new skills, and do fun things like watch a Second City show or take a boat tour down the Chicago river.</p>
